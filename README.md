# Web Development Lab Assignments

> This repository contains two portfolio website projects created for a web development class. The first assignment is a basic HTML page, and the second assignment enhances the first by adding external CSS for styling.

## Assignment 1: Basic HTML Portfolio

> This is a simple, single-page personal portfolio website built using only HTML. It serves as a basic introduction to structuring a webpage.

### Features
- **About Me:** A brief introduction and profile picture.
- **Projects:** An unordered list of key projects.
- **Technical Skills:** A table outlining technical proficiencies.
- **Contact Form:** A simple contact form with basic input fields.

### Files
```Portfolio1.html```

## Assignment 2: Portfolio with External CSS
> This assignment builds upon the first by linking the HTML file to an external stylesheet (port.css). This separates the content (HTML) from the presentation (CSS), resulting in a more visually appealing and organized website.

### Enhancements
- **Styling:** Custom fonts, colors, spacing, and layout are applied.
- **Improved Layout:** Sections are more clearly defined with background colors, borders, and shadows.
- **Interactive Elements:** Links have hover effects for better user experience.
- **Responsive Design:** Includes a viewport meta tag for better viewing on different devices.
